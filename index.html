    <p>Hello, I'm John Showman. Welcome to my website!</p>
    <p>In this class, I learned a lot of about programming. At the beginning of the year we focussed on RPG maker. I enjoyed the first half of the year because i believed that RPG maker was very fun. I also believe that RPG maker was a fun way to learn programming without having to type everything in. But now more recently we have been learning about HTML and learning how to make a website. I don't think that this part is as fun as the RPG maker but it still give us important skills in programming. </p>
